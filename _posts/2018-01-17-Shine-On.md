---

It's time to round up this year of blogging. Basically, not much happened.

- 11-28: [I made this blog](../Hello-World). Later, [I gave the fediverse user more control](../Fediverse-of-the-Future) and then failed in flying colours.
- 12-16: [I rant on why the emojo is over](../All-Social-Networks-Should-Be-Frugal).
- 12-25: Catholic Christmas.
- 12-26: Boxing Day.
- 2018-01-01: New Year.
- 2018-01-07: Orthodox Christmas.
- 2018-01-08: Boxing Day.
- 2018-01-17: **I close off this year**!

Thanks for tuning in to https://schas002.github.io/blog, wherein I'm a something-maker, and occasionally, I write a post for this blog. Here's to a [shiawasena atarash-i 2018-nen](#shinnen "happy new 2018th year")!
