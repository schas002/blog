title: All Social Networks Should Be Frugal
---

A main ingredient of Longway, my federated blog provider project, is **being frugal**. Separate features are to be added by instance servers, and they are meant to only be added ***on popular demand*** of users at the specific instance.

This doesn't just apply to Longway, this applies to every self-hosted social thing at all.

The main user story here is Mastodon.

## The story of custom emojos

A month ago, Mastodon 2.0 was released which added custom emojos. People immediately started to add them.

A week later, there is a huge overload of emojos. One or two persons' request is required to pass addition of an emojo to an instance.

A competition started of 'as much emojos as possible', and who won, you'd guess? Japanese instances, of course.

## It's not meant to be this way

Today, the only emojos I should live with are, to be crystal clear, the Mastodon logo and the Thaenkin Standard. And even then I often get away without these.

Popular demand is not one or two persons' demand.

<mark>**All social networks should be frugal and simple, that's it**</mark>. And even Facebook and Twitter are not an exception.

I come to Facebook to share some things in a long form with my friends, ***so be it***. I want to not play social games which require *Flash*.

I come to Twitter to share some things in a short form with my followers, ***so be it***. I want to not write long names, 280 character tweets, or fend out nazis.
