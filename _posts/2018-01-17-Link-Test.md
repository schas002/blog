[*This is a testing blog post for testing purposes, so that I do know how to interlink.*]

- This is a link to [`test`](test) in this folder.
- This is a link to [`./test`](./test) in this folder. You betcha both are equivalent.
- This is a link to [`../test`](../test) above this folder.
- This is a link to [`/test`](/test). No idea why would I use *this*.
